        "to the be", we return documents that contain phrases like "to the bearnaise", "to the best",
        "to the behemoth", and so on. I.e., we require that the query phrase starts on a token boundary in the
        document, but it doesn't necessarily have to end on one.

        The matching documents are ranked according to how many times the query substring occurs in the document,
        and only the "best" matches are yielded back to the client. Ties are resolved arbitrarily.

        The client can supply a dictionary of options that controls this query evaluation process: The maximum
        number of documents to return to the client is controlled via the "hit_count" (int) option.

        The results yielded back to the client are dictionaries having the keys "score" (int) and
        "document" (Document).
