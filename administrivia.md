# Administrivia

Welcome to this semester's installment of IN3120/IN4120! Some administrivia:

* I (aleksaoh) will be your Professor, and the one that lectures unless otherwise noted. There will be two Teaching Assistants (TAs) this semester: Oliver (oliverrj) and Truls (trulshes).

* There is a [semester home page](https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/ifi/IN3120/h24/index.html). There you'll find a preliminary lecture plan, links to recordings of lectures, information about the final exam, and more.

* For anything having to do with the [obligatory assignments](./README.md), please contact the TAs as your first stop. Specifically, regarding the assignment deadlines, you are entitled to a 3 day extension for any reason upon request. To request an extension, contact one of the TAs before the original deadline stating your request. The request will be granted as long as the communication is timestamped no later than the original deadline. It is not possible to request more than one extension per assignment.

* We'll use [Mattermost](https://www.uio.no/english/services/it/phone-chat-videoconf/chat/mattermost/) to disseminate important information and announcements as the semester progresses. We will _not_ use the one-way message-posting functionality on the semester home page. Mattermost facilitates two-way communications, topical channels, and more, and a dedicated Mattermost team is set up for the course. Enrollment into this Mattermost team happens automagically, and is programmatically controlled via the university's administrative systems: If you are formally registered as taking the course or are otherwise formally associated with the course, you'll get access. If you don't have access, you're probably not properly registered. If you have reason to believe that you are properly registered but still don't have access, or if you otherwise need help to troubleshoot access problems, get in touch with [these guys](https://www.mn.uio.no/ifi/tjenester/it/kontakt/kontakt.html).

* This is a so-called "cloned course", meaning that you might be taking the course either as IN3120 (if you're taking it as part of a BSc program) or as IN4120 (if you're taking it as part of a MSc program.) The courses are basically identical regardless of the course code: The final exam will be the same, the lectures will be the same, and the obligatory assignments will be the same. The only difference is that IN4120 students will have an extra, mandatory [science fair](./science-fair.md).

* The lectures will, by default, be held in Norwegian. I'll be more than happy to hold them in English if more than three students let me know that they prefer this. All written course materials (textbook, supplementary papers, lecture slides, assignments, etc) will be in English, as will the [final exam](./exams/README.md), so it shouldn't be a problem to follow the course also if you're an exchange student. (Previously I used to hold the lectures in English if at least one student let me know that they preferred this. However, I then received feedback from other students that they found the lectures more rewarding when they were given in Norwegian, so considering that the vast majority of the students are in fact Norwegian-speaking, upping the threshold on the number of English-requests seems like a decent compromise.)

* We'll use the [Stanford textbook on information retrieval](https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/information-retrieval-book.html). You can download it in PDF format, or you can buy a paper copy of the book at [Akademika](https://www.akademika.no/butikker/akademika-blindern). See also [Leganto](https://www.uio.no/tjenester/it/utdanning/leganto/) for details. This is a great introductory textbook, but is arguably a bit dated in places considering it was published in 2008. There are a lot of interesting and important algorithms and data structures relevant to the multi-disciplinary field of search technology that the textbook doesn't really cover, so to this end, we'll complement the textbook with [slides](./slides/README.md) and [papers](./papers/README.md). See also [here](./notes.md).
